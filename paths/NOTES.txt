This folder contains a Prolog file, `paths.pl` file, that is automatically
loaded by the Prolog integration scripts and shortcuts. This file defines
essential library paths for starting Logtalk and library paths for the
Logtalk standard library and for the supplied examples and contributions.

You might need to edit the `paths.pl` file in order to adapt it to 
reflect your Logtalk installation, Prolog compiler, and operating-system 
requirements. However, as defined, the provided `paths.pl` file is already
compatible with the supported back-end Prolog compilers running on MacOS X,
Windows, Linux, Unix, and Unix-like operating-systems.

Although you could customize this file by adding the paths to your own
"libraries" (in order to easily load your own source code), this is
preferably accomplished by customizing the settings file in the Logtalk
user directory.

When manually loading Logtalk (instead of using the provided integration
scripts and shortcuts), you will need to load the `paths.pl` into your
Prolog compiler before loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime to ensure
Logtalk proper startup and to easily compile and load library and example
source files using the notation `<library>(<entity>)`.
