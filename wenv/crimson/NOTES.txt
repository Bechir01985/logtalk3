This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring 
for editing Logtalk source files with Crimson Editor V3.60 or later 
version:

	http://www.crimsoneditor.com/

To install these files do the following:

1. Copy the file extension.lgt to the "link" folder on the Crimson
installation directory.

2. Copy the files logtalk.key and logtalk.spc to the "spec" folder on 
the Crimson installation directory.

Note: The Crimson installation directory is usually:

	C:\Program Files\Crimson Editor

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
