This folder contains a simple Logtalk language definition for the
LaTeX package "listings":

	http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/

To use the language definition copy the "lstlang0.sty" to the same
folder where you have the LaTeX source files that you're typesetting
and add the following line to your main LaTeX file:

\usepackage{textcomp}

This package is required as the Logtalk language definition sets the
"upquote" option to true.
