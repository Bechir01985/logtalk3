file.

This example provides basic on-line help for Logtalk when running in
a limited set of operating-systems and back-end Prolog compilers.
Currently, support is limited to:

- Operating-systems:
	Linux, MacOS X, and Windows
	
- Prolog compilers:
	B-Prolog, Ciao Prolog, CxProlog, ECLiPSe, GNU Prolog,
	Qu-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, XSB, and YAP

On Windows, the `start` command must be available. On Linux, the
`xdg-open` command must be available.

The limited support for back-end Prolog compilers is due to the lack
of portable access to the operating-system. This example relies on the
`cc` example to provide a portable operating-system access abstraction.
