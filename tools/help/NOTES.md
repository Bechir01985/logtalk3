This tool provides basic on-line help for Logtalk when running in a
limited set of operating-systems. Currently, support is limited to
Linux, MacOS X, and Windows.

On Windows, the `start` command must be available. On Linux, the `xdg-open`
command must be available. On MacOS X, the command `open` is used.

This tool relies on the library portable operating-system access abstraction.

All source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a
tab width equivalent to 4 spaces).
