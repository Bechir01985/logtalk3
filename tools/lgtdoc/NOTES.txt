This folder contains the default Logtalk documenting tool. It can
be loaded by typing:

	| ?- logtalk_load(lgtdoc(loader)).

Documenting Logtalk source code (with this tool) requires compiling
source files using the `source_data(on)` compiler option. For example:

	| ?- logtalk_load(my_shining_code, [source_data(on)]).

In alternative, you may also set the `source_data` flag to `on` by
typing:

	| ?- set_logtalk_flag(source_data, on).

This documenting tool uses Logtalk's structural reflection support
to extract and output in XML format relevant documentation about a
source code file, a library of source files, or all loaded source
files.

All source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting
is a tab width equivalent to 4 spaces).
