Overview
--------

The `ports.lgt` source file defines a simple box model (as in the debugger)
port profiler tool. It's inspired by the ECLiPSe `port_profiler` tool. It
can be loaded using the query:

	| ?- logtalk_load(ports(loader)).

The Logtalk predicate execution box model is an extended version of the
original Byrdâ€™s four port model. Besides the `call`, `exit`, `fail`, and
`redo` ports, Logtalk also defines two unification ports, `fact` and `redo`,
and an `exception` port. This tool counts the number of times each port is
traversed during the execution of queries. It also distinguishes between
deterministic exits and exits that leave choice-points (represented using
`*exit` in the profiling result tables).

All source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).


Compiling source files for port profiling
-----------------------------------------

To compile source files for port profiling, simply compiling them in debug
mode. For example:

	| ?- logtalk_load(my_source_file, [debug(on)]).

You can also simply turn on the `debug` flag globally before compiling your
source files:

	| ?- set_logtalk_flag(debug, on).


Generating profiling data
-------------------------

After loading this tool and compiling the source files that you want to profile
in debug mode, simply call the goals to be profiled.


Printing profiling data reports
-------------------------------

After calling the goals that you want to profile, you can print a table with 
all profile data by typing:

	| ?- ports::data.

To print a table with data for a single entity, use the query:

	| ?- ports::data(Entity).

The profiling data can be reset using the query:

	| ?- ports::reset.

To reset only the data about a single entity, use the query:

	| ?- ports::reset(Entity).
