This folder contains some useful programming tools. To load all tools,
type:

	| ?- logtalk_load(tools(loader)).

To load a specific tool either change your Prolog working directory
to the tool folder and then compile and load the corresponding loader 
utility file or simply use library notation as argument for the 
compiling and loading predicates. For example:

	| ?- logtalk_load(lgtunit(loader)).

Currently, the following tools are available, each one with its own
`loader.lgt` and `NOTES.txt` files:

- assertions
- debugger
- diagrams
- help
- lgtdoc
- lgtunit
- profiler

All source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).

Specific notes about each tool can be found in the corresponding `NOTES.txt`
files. Basic XHTML documentation about each tool can be found on the `docs`
directory (open the `tools.html` file in your web browser). To regenerate
this documentation, start Logtalk with your favorite back-end Prolog compiler
and follow these steps:

1. If the `source_data` flag is not `on` by default, type the query:

	| ?- set_logtalk_flag(source_data, on).

2. Load all the tools using the query:

    | ?- {tools(loader)}.

3. Generate the XML documenting files for all loaded tools using the query:

	| ?- lgtdoc::rlibrary(tools, [xmldir('$LOGTALKUSER/docs/tmp')]).

4. Run the command `lgt2html` on the `$LOGTALKUSER/docs/tmp` directory 
to generate (X)HTML documentation or the command `lgt2pdf` to generate
PDF documentation. For example:

	$ cd $LOGTALKUSER/docs/tmp
	$ lgt2html -i tools.html -t "Tools documentation index"

After generating the (X)HTML and/or PDF documentation, you can move the
files to the upper directory, `$LOGTALKUSER/docs`, and delete the temporary
directory.
