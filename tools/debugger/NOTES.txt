This folder contains the default Logtalk command-line debugger. It can
be loaded by typing:

	| ?- logtalk_load(debugger(loader)).

Debugging Logtalk source code (with this debugger) requires compiling
source files using the `debug(on)` compiler option. For example:

	| ?- logtalk_load(my_buggy_code, [debug(on)]).

In alternative, you may also set the `debug` flag to `on` by typing:

	| ?- set_logtalk_flag(debug, on).

Logtalk also supports the SWI-Prolog graphical tracer. The required
settings are described in the `settings-sample.lgt` file.

All source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is
a tab width equivalent to 4 spaces).
