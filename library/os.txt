To load all entities in this group load the `os_loader.lgt` utility file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(os_loader)).

These entities define a portable operating-system interface for the
supported backend Prolog compilers. Some predicates may only be supported
by a subset of backend Prolog compilers on a subset of operating-systems.
They should be used with care and fully tested in your application domain
as some backend Prolog compilers have buggy and inconsistent interfaces to
the operating-system.
