To load all entities in this library load the `random_loader.lgt`
utility file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(random_loader)).

The `random` object implements portable random number generators.

If you need more than one random number generator, using different
seeds, define new objects as extensions of the `random` object. Be
sure to initialize the seeds of the new random generator objects
by using the `reset_seed/0` message.
