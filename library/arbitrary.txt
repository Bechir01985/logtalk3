The `arbitrary_loader.lgt` file loads the `type` object and the `arbitrary`
category:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(arbitrary_loader)).

The `arbitrary` category adds predicates for generating random values
for selected types to the `type` object, complementing its type checking
predicates. Both the object and the category predicates can be extended
by the user with definitions for new types by defining clauses for
multifile predicates.
