To load all entities in this library load the `events_loader.lgt` utility 
file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(events_loader)).

The objects `event_registry`, `before_event_registry`, and `after_event_registry`
implement convenient predicates for registering before and after events.

The code makes use of the `monitoring` built-in protocol, which declares the two
basic event handler predicates (`before/3` and `after/3`). You will need to refer
to this protocol in your objects if you want to use the super control structure
`(^^/1)` with these predicates.

The monitor object implements more sophisticated event handling predicates.

Some of the objects assume that the chosen Prolog compiler defines the Prolog
standard `sort/2` built-in predicate.
