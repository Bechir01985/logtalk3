To load all entities in this group load the `dates_loader.lgt` utility 
file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(dates_loader)).

The object date implements some useful calendar date predicates.

The object time implements some useful time predicates.

Please note that some of the functionality of these objects depends 
on the chosen Prolog support for accessing operating system time and 
date values.
