To load all entities in this group load the `assignvars_loader.lgt` utility 
file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(assignvars_loader)).

The `assignvarsp` protocol declares the predicates used for logical assignment 
of Prolog terms developed by Nobukuni Kino.

The `assignvars` object provides a declarative implementation of the `assignvarsp`
protocol. It can be used with any backend Prolog compiler. 

The `nd_assignvars` object provides a non-declarative but faster implementation
of the `assignvarsp` protocol. It can be used with the following backend Prolog
compilers: B-Prolog, CxProlog, ECLiPSe, GNU Prolog, Qu-Prolog, SICStus Prolog,
SWI-Prolog, and YAP.
