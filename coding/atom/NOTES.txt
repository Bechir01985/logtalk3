Atom is a multiple platform text editor available from:

	https://atom.io

Atom supports converting TextMate language bundles into language support
packages. The conversion process is described at:

	https://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle

The following shell command can be used:

	$ apm init --package ~/.atom/packages/language-logtalk --convert $LOGTALKHOME/coding/textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle

If the `apm` command is not available, you can install it by selecting Atom's
menu option `Install Shell Commands`.

In alternative, a third-party maintained converted bundle is readily available
from:

	https://atom.io/packages/language-logtalk

Several Atom packages can be useful for Logtalk development. Those include:

1. `process-palette`

The provided `process-palette.json` file defines commands for compiling a file
from within Atom allowing clicking on warnings and errors and jump to their
location, for running unit tests, for scanning for dead code, for generating
HTML documentation, and for generating diagrams.

For using these commands, install the `process-palette` package and replace
or merge the contents of the file with default file found at `~/.atom`. If
no `~/.atom/process-palette.json` file exists just copy the provided file
to `~/.atom`. Customization of this file is usually required to select your
preferred Prolog backend and keyboard shortcuts. The package settings may also
need to be edited to select the shell to be use (notably, on Windows, a Bash
shell must be specified; e.g. the Bash shell provided by Git for Windows).

2. `atom_ctags`

By installing this package and the Logtalk ctags support (see `../ctags`), it
is possible to use Atom's `Command Palette` to index and browse Logtalk code.

3. `atom-html-preview`

One of the packages that allows convenient rendering of HTML files, including
those generated for API documentation of Logtalk code.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
