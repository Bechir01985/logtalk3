Atom is a multiple platform text editor available from:

	https://atom.io

Atom supports converting TextMate language bundles into language support
packages. The conversion process is described at:

	https://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle

The following shell command can be used:

	$ apm init -p ~/.atom/packages/language-logtalk --template $LOGTALKHOME/coding/textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
