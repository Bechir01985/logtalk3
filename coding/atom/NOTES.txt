Atom is a multiple platform text editor available from:

	https://atom.io

Atom supports converting TextMate language bundles into language support
packages. The conversion process is described at:

	https://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle

The following shell command can be used:

	$ apm init --package ~/.atom/packages/language-logtalk --convert $LOGTALKHOME/coding/textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle

If the `apm` command is not available, you can install it by selecting Atom's
menu option `Install Shell Commands`.

In alternative, a third-party maintained converted bundle is readily available
from:

	https://atom.io/packages/language-logtalk

Several Atom packages can be useful for Logtalk development. As an example,
the file `process-palette.json` defines commands for compiling a file from
within Atom allowing clicking on warnings and errors and jump to their
location, for scanning for dead code, and for generating HTML documentation.
For using these commands, install the `process-palette` package and replace
or merge the contents of the file with default file found at `~/.atom`.
Customize the file if necessary e.g. to select your preferred Prolog backend
and keyboard shortcuts. Also install a HTML preview package such as
`atom-html-preview`.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
