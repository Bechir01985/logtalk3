This directory contains files that provide basic syntax highlighting 
and entity index for editing Logtalk source files with the Bare Bones
BBEdit 8.5 (and later versions) or TextWrangler 2.x text editors:

	http://www.barebones.com/

To install copy the file "logtalk.plist" either to the folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
	~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/

or to the folders:

	/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
	/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/

(create the folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
