This directory contains the Logtalk.mode bundle, which provides syntax 
highlighting, code folding, code completion, and entity index for editing
Logtalk source files with the SubEthaEdit 2.x text editor:

	http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/

To install copy the bundle "Logtalk.mode" to one of the following 
folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
	/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
	/Network/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/

(create the chosen folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
