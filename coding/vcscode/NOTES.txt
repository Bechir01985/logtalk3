This directory contains a preliminary extension for editing Logtalk source
files with the Visual Studio Code text editor: 

	http://code.visualstudio.com/

To install, copy the `pmoura.logtalk-0.0` folder to the following folder:

	~/.vscode/extensions

(create the folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.

Snippets are provided for entities and entity predicates. In the case of
entities, the defined triggers are: object, class, instance, protocol, and
category. In the case of predicates, the defined triggers are: public,
protected, and private.
