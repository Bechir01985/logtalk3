This directory contains files that provide support for using version 3.15 
or later of the Highlight package by Andre Simon with Logtalk source files.
A detailed description on the Highlight package is available from:

	http://www.andre-simon.de/


These support files are dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License 3
and the Highlight license.

In order to check if your Highlight installation already includes support 
for Logtalk, you may use the following command:

	% highlight --list-langs

Look in the resulting listing for the `lgt` extension. If support for Logtalk 
is not included or if it is outdated, copy the file `logtalk.lang` to the
folder:

	$prefix/share/highlight/langDefs/

where `$prefix` is the Highlight installation directory (by default, `/usr`).
There's also a `lgt.lang` file for older 2.x versions of Highlight.

Usage example for a `foo.lgt` Logtalk source file:

	% highlight --replace-tabs=4 --xhtml --input=foo.lgt --output=foo.html --style=kwrite

You should try different style files (using the `--style` option) in order to 
find which ones provide the more satisfactory results. As Logtalk files are 
usually formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces), the option `--replace-tabs=4` may be necessary to
keep you source code properly formatted.

You may also use the "lgt.lang" file with plain Prolog files by using the 
`--syntax` option. For example:

	% highlight --syntax=lgt --xhtml --input=foo.pl --output=foo.html

THIS SYNTAX COLORING FILE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
