Sublime Text is a text editor for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
It's available from:

	http://www.sublimetext.com/

Sublime Text supports TextMate syntax files and TextMate snippets. See the
`../textmate` folder and the Sublime Text documentation for more information.

For basic installation, copy the following files to the Sublime Text Packages
directory, which is operating-system specific:

Mac OS X:
	~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Logtalk/
Linux:
	~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Logtalk
Windows:
	%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\Logtalk

Create the `Logtalk` subdirectory if it doesn't exist. The files to be
copied are:

1. File `../textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle/Syntaxes/Logtalk.plist` renamed
to `Logtalk.tmLanguage`.

2. All files in the `../textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle/Snippets` directory

3. File `logtalk.sublime-completions`

4. File `Logtalk.sublime-build`

Create a `Sublime Text 3/Packages/SublimeREPL/config/Logtalk` subdirectory
if it doesn't exist and copy the following two files there:

	Default.sublime-commands
	Main.sublime-menu

The build and REPL support are experimental and currently not available on
Windows. It requires that you first run the `logtalk_backend_select` shell
script to set your default backend compiler. In alternative, edit the
`Logtalk.sublime-build` and `Main.sublime-menu` files and change the names
of the integration scripts.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
