Sublime Text is a text editor for Windows, MacOS X, and Linux.
It's available from:

	http://www.sublimetext.com/

Sublime Text (version 1.03 or later) supports TextMate syntax files and
TextMate snippets (version 1.2 or later). See the `../textmate` folder
and the Sublime Text documentation for more information.

For basic installation, copy the following files to the Sublime Text Packages
directory at `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Logtalk/`
(create the `Logtalk` subdirectory if it doesn't exist):

1. File `../textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle/Syntaxes/logtalk.plist`

2. All files in the `../textmate2/Logtalk.tmbundle/Snippets` directory

3. File `logtalk.sublime-completions`

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
