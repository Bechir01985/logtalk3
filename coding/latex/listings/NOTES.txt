This folder contains a simple Logtalk language definition for the
LaTeX package `listings`:

	http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/

To use the language definition copy the `lstlang0.sty` to the same
folder where you have the LaTeX source files that you're typesetting
and add the following lines to your main LaTeX file:

	\usepackage{listings}
	\usepackage{textcomp}

The `textcomp` package is required as the Logtalk language definition
sets the `upquote` option to true.

If you want keywords in bold face in the code listings, you will also
need to use fonts that support that face. You can use e.g. one of the
following packages:

	\usepackage[scaled=0.8]{couriers}

or:

	\usepackage{pxfonts}

Default options for all code listings can be set using something like:

	\lstset{
		language=Logtalk,
		basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,
		keywordstyle=\bfseries,
		tabsize=4,
		numbers=none, numberstyle=\tiny, stepnumber=1, numbersep=5pt,
		showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false,
		captionpos=b,
		frame=lines,
		upquote=true,
		framextopmargin=6pt, framexbottommargin=6pt,
		aboveskip=\medskipamount, lineskip={-2.0pt}
	}

If you need to highlight additional keywords, you can always use the
`morekeywords` option as an alternative to edit the `lstlang0.sty`
file. For example:

	morekeywords={extends_object, implements_protocol}

Consult the `listings` package documentation (e.g. by running the command
`texdoc listings`) and experiment with the above settings to get the exact
appearance that your publication requires.
