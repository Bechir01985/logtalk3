This directory contains the `logtalk.py` file that provides syntax 
coloring support for Pygments (version 0.9 or later):

	http://pygments.org/

This support file is dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License 3
and the Pygments license.

Pygments includes support for Logtalk since version 0.10 as you can check using
the command:

	$ pygmentize -H lexer Logtalk

If support for Logtalk is outdated, replace its definition in the following file
(its prefix depends on where Python is installed):

	site-packages/pygments/lexers/other.py

with the contents of the `logtalk.py` from the Logtalk distribution and compile
the updated file:

	$ python -m py_compile other.py	

Finally, rebuild the lexer mappings by typing:

	$ python _mapping.py

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces). This can be specified by using the `whitespace`
filter option `tabsize`:

	$ pygmentize -F whitespace:tabsize=4 -O full,style=friendly -o source.html source.lgt

When your source file uses an encoding other than ASCII or ISO-Latin-1, 
you will need to use the `encoding` option. For example:

	$ pygmentize -F whitespace:tabsize=4 -O encoding=utf8 -o babel.html babel.lgt

As the Pygments syntax highlighting engine itself, the `logtalk.py` file 
is licensed under the BSD license.

You may also use the Logtalk lexer with plain Prolog files by using the `-l` 
option. For example:

	$ pygmentize -l logtalk -O full,style=friendly -o source.html source.pl
