This folder contains minimal support for using Exuberant Ctags 
(http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) with Logtalk. There is one file
that you will need to copy to your home directory:

	ctags
		Copy this file to "$HOME/.ctags" or append its contents to
		the "$HOME/.ctags" file if it already exists

If you're using the MacOS X TextMate and its TmCodeBrowser plug-in
(http://www.cocoabits.com/TmCodeBrowser/), copy the "ctags" file to
"$HOME/.ctags.tmcodebrowser" or append its contents to the
"$HOME/.ctags.tmcodebrowser" file if it already exists.

If you're using the Vim text editor, you can install the "Tag List"
plugin in order to enable a source code browser for Logtalk (and other)
source files:

	http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/

After installing the plugin, add the following line to your .vimrc file:

let tlist_logtalk_settings = 'logtalk;o:Objects;p:Protocols;c:Categories;u:Public predicates;r:Protected predicates;v:Private predicates'
