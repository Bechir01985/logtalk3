This folder contains minimal support for using Exuberant Ctags  with Logtalk:

	http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

To install, copy the `ctags` file to `$HOME/.ctags` or append its contents to
the `$HOME/.ctags` file if it already exists.

If you're using the MacOS X TextMate and its TmCodeBrowser plug-in available at:

	http://www.cocoabits.com/TmCodeBrowser/

Copy the `ctags` file to `$HOME/.ctags.tmcodebrowser` or append its contents to
the `$HOME/.ctags.tmcodebrowser` file if it already exists.

If you're using the Vim text editor, you can install the "Tag List" plugin in
order to enable a source code browser for Logtalk (and other) source files:

	http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/

After installing the plugin, add the following line to your `.vimrc` file:

	let tlist_logtalk_settings = 'logtalk;o:Objects;p:Protocols;c:Categories;m:Modules;u:Public predicates;r:Protected predicates;v:Private predicates'
