This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring, 
entity and public predicate index, and code completion for editing 
Logtalk source files with the text editor SuperEdi 3.8.1 or later 
version:

	http://www.wolosoft.com/en/superedi/index.html

Install the supporting files by performing the following steps:

1.	Copy the file `Logtalk.syn` to the `Syntax` directory in your 
	SuperEdi installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

2.	Copy the file `Logtalk.col` to the `Syntax` directory in your 
	SuperEdi installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

3.	Go to the Tools/Options dialog and create a new file type named 
	`Logtalk`. Set the file extensions to `lgt` and `logtalk` and the
	syntax and color scheme to `Logtalk`. Set the tab size to `4`.

THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
