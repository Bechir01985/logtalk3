This directory contains some files that provide basic syntax highlighting 
and project and template files for editing Logtalk source files with MacOS X 
Xcode 1.1 or later version.


To install:

1. Copy the files "logtalk.pbfilespec" and "logtalk.pblangspec" to the 
directory:

	~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Specifications 

2. Copy the directory "Logtalk" to the directory:
 
	~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/File Templates 

3. Create (if it does not exist) the directory:

	~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Project Templates/Logtalk

and copy to it the directory Logtalk Application


Although the file logtalk.pblangspec provides basic syntax coloring for the 
Logtalk language, it is recommended that you configure Xcode to use an 
external text editor such as SubEthaEdit or TextMate for editing Logtalk 
source files.


SUPPORT FOR THIS IDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
