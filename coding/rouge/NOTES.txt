This directory contains the `logtalk.rb` file that provides syntax 
coloring support for Rouge (version 1.9.1 or later):

	http://rouge.jneen.net/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the
Rouge license.

Rouge may already include support for Logtalk. You can check it by running
the command:

	$ rougify list

If support for Logtalk is outdated, replace its definition in the following
file (its prefix depends on where Rouge is installed):

	rouge/lib/lexers/rouge/logtalk.rb

with the contents of the `logtalk.rb` from the Logtalk distribution.

An example of generating HTML code (wrapped with a `pre` tag) would be:

	$ rougify highlight -f html source.lgt > source.html

To get the CSS file used for the generated HTML code use the command:

	$ rougify style > source.css

An useful formatter option is line numbers:

	$ rougify highlight -f html -F line_numbers=true source.lgt > source.html

You may also use the Logtalk lexer with plain Prolog files by using the `-l` 
option. For example:

	$ rougify highlight -l logtalk source.pl > source.html
