To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This example requires using SWI-Prolog as the backend Prolog compiler.
It illustrates using a SWI-Prolog XPCE GUI toolkit with Logtalk.

This example directory includes generic code in the files `xpce_hooks.pl`
and `xpce_includes.pl` that can be reused as-is for interfacing XPCE and
Logtalk.

The example itself is a straightforward adaptation of an example from the
XPCE user manual.
