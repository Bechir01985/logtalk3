This folder contains an example of using conditional compilation to implement
a portable operating-system interface for the following Prolog compilers: YAP,
SWI-Prolog, XSB, GNU-Prolog, B-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, ECLiPSe, Ciao, CxProlog,
Qu-Prolog, and Lean Prolog. For other back-end Prolog compilers, a warning is
printed.

Note that this is just an example of using the conditional compilation
directives. This code should not be used without careful testing in a
production environment.
