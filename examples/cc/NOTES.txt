This folder used to contain an example of using conditional compilation to
implement a portable operating-system interface for the supported backend
Prolog compilers. Those resources have been moved as per Logtalk release
3.00.0 Alpha 34 to the library directory. This example is kept, however,
to maintain compatibility with existing applications that use this portable
operating-system interface and to hold for now a set of unit tests.
