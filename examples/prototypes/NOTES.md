This is a simple example illustrating the concept of prototypes, which provide
an alternative to classes for object-oriented programming, using characters
from the Alf television sitcom. Logtalk supports both classes and prototypes.
It can be used as either a prototype-based language or a class-based language.
Moreover, prototypes and classes can be freely used in the same application.

Class-based OOP languages are far more popular and, unfortunately, many books
and teaching materials equate OOP languages with class-based OOP languages.
Some examples of other prototype-based OOP languages include Self, JavaScript,
Io, NewtonScript, Lua, and Slate.
