% start by loading the example by choosing one of the plain Prolog files
% (you must quit and restart Logtalk for each testing scenario):

| ?- logtalk_load(bench(loader)).
...

| ?- ['$LOGTALKUSER/examples/bench/boyer.pl'].
yes


% load the "lgtunit" tool so that we can use its benchmark predicates:

| ?- logtalk_load(lgtunit(loader)).
...


% benchmark both the plain Prolog and the Logtalk versions:

| ?- lgtunit::benchmark(top,1000,Time).
Time = ...
yes

| ?- lgtunit::benchmark(boyer::top,1000,Time).
Time = ...
yes

% for accurate timings of ::/2 goals, the lgtunit::benchmark/3 calls
% should be made from compiled code in order to avoid the top-level
% interpretation of the goals; an handy alternative is to use:

| ?- logtalk<<(lgtunit::benchmark(boyer::top,1000,Time)).
Time = ...
yes
