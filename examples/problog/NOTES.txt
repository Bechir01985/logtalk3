To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT.txt file.

This highly experimental example requires the use of YAP as the back-end
compiler, with a working installation of the optional ProbLog package.
The individual examples are adaptations of the examples distributed with
ProbLog.

For details on ProbLog see:

ProbLog defines a ::/2 operator for probabilistic clauses that conflicts with
Logtalk ::/2 message sending operator. As a workaround, the Logtalk versions
of the ProbLog examples use a ~/2 operator for probabilistic clauses.

Bugs and limitations on the current ProbLog version (which is under heavy
development) result in lack of independence between examples. Until these 
problems are solved, the loader file may need to be edit to load a single 
example at a time. Moreover, the Logtalk session may need to be restarted 
between queries.
