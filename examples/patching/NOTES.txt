This folder contains an example that shows how to use a complementing
category to patch broken object predicate declarations and definitions 
(without modifying its source code), thus providing functionality similar
to Objective-C categories.

The complemented objects must be compiled with the flag "complements" set
to "allow" (its default value is usually "deny") and the flag "reload" set
to "always". This solution was adapted to improve performance of applications
that don't make use complementing categories and to provide a solution for
preventing the use of categories to break object encapsulation. Note that
the "complements" flag can be set on a per-object basis by using the
set_logtalk_flag/2 directive.
