% start by loading the non-patched object "employee":

| ?- logtalk_load(complements_allow(employee)).
...


%  ask "employee" its name:

| ?- employee::name(Name).

Name = john
yes


% check the protocol of the object "employee":

| ?- findall(Predicate, employee::current_predicate(Predicate), Predicates).

Predicates = [age/1, name/1, salary/1]
yes


% now load the "add_on" complementing category:

| ?- logtalk_load(complements_allow(add_on)).
...


% find categories that complement objects:

| ?- complements_object(Category, Object).
Category = add_on,
Object = employee.
yes 


% use the event handler defined in the "add_on" category for the object "employee":

| ?- employee::name(Name).
Received message name(_16) from user

Name = john
yes


% check the new protocol of the object "employee":

| ?- employee::predicates(Predicates).
Received message predicates(_G180) from user

Predicates = [after/3, age/1, before/3, income/1, name/1, predicates/1, salary/1]
yes

| ?- employee::predicate_property(predicates(_), Property).
