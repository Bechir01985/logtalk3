To example contains only unit tests for the Redis client library but
these tests also serve as examples of using this library. To run all
the unit tests, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

The unit tests were originally written by Sean Charles for his GNU Prolog
Redis client library:

	https://github.com/emacstheviking/gnuprolog-redisclient

The Logtalk version is a straight-forward of the original tests using
the `test/1` dialect of `lgtunit`.
