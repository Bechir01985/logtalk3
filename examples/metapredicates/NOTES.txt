This example shows the use of meta-predicates in Logtalk. Meta-predicates are 
predicates whose head contains arguments that will be called as goals in the 
body of the predicate definition.

This example defines the following objects:

    company
        usage example of the map_reduce/5 meta-predicate

    fibonacci
        example of calculating Fibonacci numbers using the fold_left/4
        meta-predicate

	sort(_)
		this is a parametric object containing a method that implements the
		quicksort sorting algorithm; the parameter is interpreted as the type
		of the elements being sorted
	
	tracer
		this object implements a meta-predicate that is used by sort(_) to 
		trace the sorting algorithm steps

	metapreds
	descendant
	test
		objects used for illustrating the use of clusures as meta-arguments

	predicates
		object defining some predicates for testing meta-predicates defined 
		in the Logtalk library
