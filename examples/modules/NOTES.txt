This example illustrates compilation of Prolog module files as objects. This
compilation is triggered by using the Logtalk source file extension for the
Prolog module files.

Due to the lack of standardization of Prolog module systems, the module 
files must use only a common subset of Prolog module directives. Consult 
the "Prolog Integration and Migration Guide" in the Logtalk documentation 
for details.
