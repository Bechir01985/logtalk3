This directory contains files used when building Linux RPM packages.

The `build_rpm.sh` shell script makes the following assumptions:

(1) The `~/.rpmmacros` configuration file contains the definition:
 
	%_topdir      %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild

(2) The `~/rpmbuild` directory structure already exists (the command
`rpmdev-setuptree` can be used to create these structure).

The necessary `logtalk.spec` file is generated by the `build_rpm.sh`
shell script by processing the `logtalk.spec.in` file.
