%description
Logtalk is an object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a backend compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
