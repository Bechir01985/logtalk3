<h2>5. Installation</h2>

<p>Logtalk can be installed either from sources by running a few shell scripts 
or by using one of the provided installers, depending on your operating 
system. For manual installation, see the file <code>INSTALL.md</code> for detailed 
instructions.</p>

<p>See the user manual for a description of the source files organization 
and for using instructions (to read the user manual open the file 
<code>manuals/index.html</code> with a web browser). Source files are formatted 
using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width equivalent to 4 spaces).</p>

<h2>6. Customization</h2>

<p>The file <code>CUSTOMIZE.md</code> provides detailed instructions for customizing the  
Logtalk installation and working environment.</p>

<h2>7. Running</h2>

<p>The file <code>QUICK_START.md</code> provides quick instructions for those of you in a hurry 
to run Logtalk, provided that your favorite Prolog compiler is supported.</p>

<h2>8. Documentation</h2>

<p>The reference and user manuals and the tutorial are provided in XHTML format 
and can be found in the "manuals" directory.</p>

<p>The file <code>RELEASE_NOTES.txt</code> contains descriptions of all Logtalk updates since the 
first public version. Read it carefully if you have been using a previous 
Logtalk version.</p>

<h2>9. Upgrading</h2>

<p>If you are upgrading from a previous Logtalk version, please check the file

<h2>11. Contributions</h2>

<p>Contributions, constructive criticism, patches, bug reports, and suggestions
are always welcome. However, major code contributions to core files, such as
the compiler, runtime, adapter files, library files, or tools can only be
accepted with a transfer of copyright or if the submitted code is explicitly
declared as public domain code. This simplifies the selling of commercial
licenses, which provide a revenue source for the sustained development of
Logtalk.</p>

<p>Happy Logtalking!</p>
