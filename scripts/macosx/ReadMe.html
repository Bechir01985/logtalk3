<h2>1. About</h2>

<p>Logtalk is an <em>object-oriented logic programming language</em> that extends and
leverages the Prolog language with a feature set suitable for programming
in the large. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both
prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based programming
through category-based composition, event-driven programming, coinduction,
and high-level multi-threading programming. Logtalk uses standard Prolog
syntax with the addition of some operators and directives and can be used
with any Prolog implementation compliant with official and de facto
standards as the back-end compiler.</p>
