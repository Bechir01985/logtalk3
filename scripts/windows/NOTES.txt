This directory contains files used when building Windows 2000/XP GUI 
installers using Inno Setup 5.1.11 (or a later version):

	http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

The building script, `logtalk.iss`, assumes that a checkout of the
Logtalk repository exists in the `C:\lgt3git` directory.

The installer creates integration shortcuts that start Logtalk in the
`%LOGTALKUSER` directory. You can edit the building script and change
the `Start in` setting to `%CD%` but this works on Windows XP but is
ignored on Windows 7.

As Logtalk first looks at startup for a `settings.lgt` file in the
current directory, in order to use a project-specific settings file,
copy the desired shortcut to the project directory and use its path
as the value of the `Start in` shortcut setting.
