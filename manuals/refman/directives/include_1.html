<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>include(File)</pre>
<p>
Includes a file contents, which must be valid terms, at the place of occurrence of the directive. The file can be specified as a relative path, an absolute path, or using library notation. Use of relative paths, however, is not advisable as backend compilers may not use the same concept of current directory when expanding the path. If the file name have an extension, it must not be omitted. When using the reflection API, all file terms share the same line number as the directive. 
</p>
<p>
This directive can be used as either a source file directive or an entity directive. As an entity directive, it can be used both in entities defined in source files and with the entity creation built-in predicates.
</p>
