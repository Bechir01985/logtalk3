<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>initialization(Goal)</pre>
<p>
When used within an object, this directive defines a goal to be called immediately after the object has been loaded into memory. When used at a global level within a source file, this directive defines a goal to be called immediately after the compiled source file is loaded into memory.
</p>
<p>
Multiple initialization directives can be used in a source file or in an object. Their goals will be called in order at loading time.
</p>
<p>
Categories and protocols cannot contain initialization directives as the initialization goals would lack a complete execution context which is only available for objects.
</p>

<h4>Template and modes</h4>

<h4>Examples</h4>
