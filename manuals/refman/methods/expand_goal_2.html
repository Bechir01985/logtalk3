<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>expand_goal(Goal, ExpandedGoal)</pre>
<p>
Expands a goal.
</p>
<p>
The expansion works as follows: if the first argument is a variable, then it is unified with the second argument; if the first argument is not a variable and there are local or inherited clauses for the <code>goal_expansion/2</code> hook predicate within scope, then this predicate is recursively called until a fixed-point is reached to provide an expansion that is then unified with the second argument; if the <code>goal_expansion/2</code> predicate is not within scope, the two arguments are unified.
</p>
<p>
Automatic goal expansion is only performed at compile time (to expand the body of clauses and meta-directives read from a source file) when using <a href="../../glossary.html#hook"><em>hook objects</em></a>. This predicate can be used by the user to manually perform goal expansion at runtime (for example, before asserting a clause).
