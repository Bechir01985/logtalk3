<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>goal_expansion(Goal, ExpandedGoal)</pre>
<p>
Defines an expansion for a goal. The first argument is the goal to be expanded. The expanded goal is returned in the second argument. This predicate is called recursively on the expanded goal until a fixed point is reached. Thus, care must be taken to avoid compilation loops. This predicate, when defined and within scope, is automatically called by the <a href="expand_goal_2.html"><code>expand_goal/2</code></a> method. Use of this predicate by the <code>expand_goal/2</code> method may be restricted by changing its default public scope.
</p>
<p>
Goal expansion may be also be applied when compiling source files by defining the object providing access to the <code>goal_expansion/2</code> clauses as a <em><a class="glossary" title="Go to glossary definition" href="../../glossary.html#hook">hook object</a></em>. Clauses for the <code>goal_expansion/2</code> predicate defined within an object or a category are <strong>never</strong> used in the compilation of the object or the category itself. Moreover, in this context, goals wrapped using the <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../control/external_call_1.html"><code>{}/1</code></a> compiler bypass control construct are not expanded and any expanded goal wrapped in this control construct will not be further expanded.
</p>
<p>
Objects and categories implementing this predicate should declare that they implement the <code>expanding</code> protocol if no ancestor already declares it. This protocol implementation relation can be declared as either protected or private to restrict the scope of this predicate.
