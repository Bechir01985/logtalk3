<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>{Term}
{Goal}</pre>
<p>
This control construct allows the programmer to bypass the Logtalk compiler. It can be used to wrap a source file term (either a clause or a directive) to bypass the term-expansion mechanism. Similarly, it can be used to wrap a goal to bypass the goal-expansion mechanism. When used to wrap a goal, it is opaque to cuts and the argument is called within the context of the pseudo-object <a class="glossary" title="Go to glossary definition" href="../../userman/objects.html#objects_user">user</a>. It is also possible to use <code>{Closure}</code> as the first argument of <code>call/2-N</code> calls. In this case, <code>Closure</code> will be extended with the remaining arguments of the <code>call/2-N</code> call in order to construct a goal that will be called within the context of <code>user</code>. It can also be used as a message to any object. This is useful when the message is e.g. a conjunction of messages, some of which being calls to Prolog built-in predicates.
</p>
<p>
This control construct may also be used in place of an object identifier when sending a message. In this case, the result of proving its argument as a goal (within the context of the pseudo-object <code>user</code>) is used as an object identifier in the message sending call. This feature is mainly used with parametric objects when the their identifiers correspond to predicates defined in <code>user</code>.

<h4>Errors</h4>

<dl>
	<dt>Term or Goal is a variable:</dt>
		<dd><code>instantiation_error</code></dd>
	<dt>Term is neither a variable nor a callable term:</dt>
		<dd><code>type_error(callable, Term)</code></dd>
	<dt>Goal is neither a variable nor a callable term:</dt>
		<dd><code>type_error(callable, Goal)</code></dd>
</dl>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre>{:- load_foreign_resource(file)}.

N1/D1 &lt; N2/D2 :-
    {N1*D2 &lt; N2*D1}.

call_in_user(F, X, Y, Z) :-
    call({F}, X, Y, Z).

| ?- {circle(Id, Radius, Color)}::area(Area).
...

| ?- logtalk::{write('Hello world!'), nl}.
Hello world!
yes
