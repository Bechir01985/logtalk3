<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>logtalk_make</pre>
<p>
Reloads all Logtalk source files that have been modified since the time they are last loaded. Only source files loaded using the <code>logtalk_load/1-2</code> predicates are reloaded. Non-modified files will also be reloaded when there is a change to the compilation mode (i.e. when the files were loaded without explicit <code>debug/1</code> or <code>optimize/1</code> flags and the default values of these flags changed after loading; no check is made, however, for other implicit compiler flags that may have changed since loading). When an included file is modified, this predicate reloads its main file (i.e. the file that contains the <code>include/1</code> directive).
</p>
<p>
Depending on the back-end Prolog compiler, the shortcut <code>{*}</code> may be used in alternative. Check the adapter files for the availability of these shortcuts as they are not part of the language (and thus should only be used at the top-level interpreter).
</p>
<p>
This predicate can be extended by the user by defining clauses for the <code>logtalk_make_target_action/1</code> multifile and dynamic hook predicate using the argument <code>all</code>. The additional user defined actions are run after the default one.
