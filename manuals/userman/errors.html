<h1 id="errors_errors">Error handling</h1>

<p>
All error handling is done in Logtalk by using the ISO defined <code>catch/3</code> and <code>throw/1</code> predicates <a title="ISO Prolog Standard" href="../bibliography.html#ISO95">[ISO 95]</a>. Errors thrown by Logtalk have the following format:
</p>
<pre>error(Error, logtalk(Goal, Entity))</pre>
<p>
In this exception term, <code>Goal</code> is the goal that triggered the error <code>Error</code> and <code>Entity</code> is the entity in whose context <code>Goal</code> is called. For example:
</p>
<pre>error(permission_error(modify,private_predicate,p), logtalk(foo::abolish(p/0),user))</pre>
<p>
Note, however, that <code>Goal</code> and <code>Entity</code> can be variables when the corresponding information is not available (usually due to compiler optimizations that throw away the necessary error context information).
</p>

<h2>Compiler warnings and errors<a id="errors_compiler"></a></h2>

<p>
The current Logtalk compiler uses the <code>read_term/3</code> ISO Prolog defined built-in predicate to read and compile a Logtalk source file. One consequence of this is that invalid Prolog terms or syntax errors may abort the compilation process with limited information given to the user (due to the inherent limitations of the <code>read_term/3</code> predicate). 
</p>
<p>
If all the terms in a source file are valid, then there is a set of errors or potential errors, described below, that the compiler will try to detect and report, depending on the used compiler flags (see the <a href="programming.html#programming_flags">Writing, running, and debugging programs</a> section of this manual for details).
</p>

<h3 id="errors_unknown">Unknown entities</h3>

<p>
The Logtalk compiler warns about any referenced entity that is not currently loaded. The warning may reveal a misspell entity name or just an entity that it will be loaded later. Out-of-oder loading should be avoided when possible as it prevents some code optimizations such as static binding od messages to methods.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_singletons">Singleton variables</h3>

<p>
Singleton variables in a clause are often misspell variables and, as such, one of the most common errors when programming in Prolog. 
when the backend Prolog compiler complies with the Prolog ISO standard or at least supports the ISO predicate <code>read_term/3</code> called with the option <code>singletons(S)</code>, the Logtalk compiler warns about any singleton variable found while compiling a source file.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_prolog">Redefinition of Prolog built-in predicates</h3>

<p>
The Logtalk compiler will warn us of any redefinition of a Prolog built-in predicate inside an object or category. Sometimes the redefinition is intended. In other cases, the user may not be aware that the subjacent Prolog compiler may already provide the predicate as a built-in or we may want to ensure code portability among several Prolog compilers with different sets of built-in predicates.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_redefinion_predicates">Redefinition of Logtalk built-in predicates</h3>

<p>
Similar to the redefinition of Prolog built-in predicates, the Logtalk compiler will warn us if we try to redefine a Logtalk built-in. The redefinition will probably be an error in almost all (if not all) cases.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_redefinion_methods">Redefinition of Logtalk built-in methods</h3>

<p>
An error will be thrown if we attempt to redefine a Logtalk built-in method inside an entity. The default behavior is to report the error and abort the compilation of the offending entity. 
</p>

<h3 id="errors_misspell">Misspell calls of local predicates</h3>

<p>
A warning will be reported if Logtalk finds (in the body of a predicate definition) a call to a local predicate that is not defined, built-in (either in Prolog or in Logtalk) or declared dynamic. In most cases these calls are simple misspell errors.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_portability">Portability warnings</h3>

<p>
A warning will be reported if a predicate clause contains a call to a non-ISO specified built-in predicate or arithmetic function, Portability warnings are also reported for non-standard flags or flag values. These warnings often cannot be avoided due to the limited scope of the ISO Prolog standard.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_missing_directives">Missing directives</h3>

<p>
A warning will be reported for any missing dynamic, discontiguous, meta-predicate, and public predicate directive.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_predicate_redefinition">Redefinition of predicates declared in <code>uses/2</code> and <code>use_module/2</code> directives</h3>

<p>
A error will be reported for any attempt to define locally a predicate that is already listed in a <code>uses/2</code> or in a <code>use_module/2</code> directive.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_others">Other warnings and errors</h3>

<p>
The Logtalk compiler will throw an error if it finds a predicate clause or a directive that cannot be parsed. The default behavior is to report the error and abort the compilation of the offending entity.
</p>

<h2 id="errors_runtime">Runtime errors</h2>

<p>
This section briefly describes runtime errors that result from misuse of Logtalk built-in predicates, built-in methods or from message sending. For a complete and detailed description of runtime errors please consult the <a title="Consult reference manual" href="../refman/index.html">Reference Manual</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_predicates">Logtalk built-in predicates</h3>

<p>
Most Logtalk built-in predicates checks the type and mode of the calling arguments, throwing an exception in case of misuse.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_methods">Logtalk built-in methods</h3>

<p>
Most Logtalk built-in method checks the type and mode of the calling arguments, throwing an exception in case of misuse.
</p>

<h3 id="errors_sending">Message sending</h3>

<p>
The message sending mechanisms always check if the receiver of a message is a defined object and if the message corresponds to a declared predicate within the scope of the sender. The built-in protocol <code>forwarding</code> declares a predicate, <code>forward/1</code>, which is automatically called (if defined) by the runtime for any message that the receiving object does not understand. The usual definition for this error handler is to delegate or forward the message to another object that might be able to answer it:
</p>
<pre>forward(Message) :-
    [Object::Message].	% forward the message while preserving the original sender</pre>
<p>
If preserving the original sender is not required, this definition can be simplified to:
</p>
<pre>forward(Message) :-
    Object::Message.</pre>
<p>
More sophisticated definitions are, of course, possible.
