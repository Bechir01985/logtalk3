.. _faq_usability_shortcuts:

Is there a shortcut for compiling and loading source files?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes. With most back-end Prolog compilers, you can use ``{File}`` as a
shortcut for ``logtalk_load(File)``. For compiling and loading
multiple files simply use ``{File1, File2, ...}``. See the documentation
of the :ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_1` predicate for details.

.. _faq_usability_ensure_loaded:

Is there an equivalent directive to the ``ensure_loaded/1`` Prolog directive?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the goal ``logtalk_load(File, [reload(skip)])`` to ensure
that ``File`` is only loaded once. See the documentation
of the :ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_2` predicate for details.

.. _faq_usability_make:

Are there shortcuts for the make functionality?
-----------------------------------------------

Yes. With most back-end Prolog compilers, you can use ``{*}`` as a
shortcut for ``logtalk_make(all)`` to reload all files modified since
last compiled and loaded, ``{!}`` as a shortcut for
``logtalk_make(clean)`` to delete all intermediate Prolog files
generated by the compilation of Logtalk source files, ``{?}`` as a
shortcut for ``logtalk_make(missing)`` to list missing entities and
predicates, and ``{@}`` as a shortcut for ``logtalk_make(circular)``
to list circular references. See the documentation
of the :ref:`predicates_logtalk_make_1` predicate for details.
