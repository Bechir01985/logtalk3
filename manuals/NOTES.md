To consult the Logtalk documentation open the file `index.html` with a
web browser.

All manual pages conform to the XHTML 1.1 W3C Standard. You may change 
the appearance of the pages by changing the included `screen.css` 
CSS file. Needless to say, the manual pages look better in recent web 
browser releases that support both the XHTML 1.1 and CSS 2 web standards.

The `print.css` CSS file can be used with CSSToXSLFO (version 1.5 or 
later) to generate PDF files with page numbers suitable for printing. 
For informations on how to use CSSToXSLFO, please see the following 
URL:

	http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/

Two scripts are provided to convert the XHTML manual pages to PDF files:

- `userman/userman.sh`  
	Bourne-compatible shell script for POSIX systems that generates
	a PDF version of the User Manual

- `refman/refman.sh`  
	Bourne-compatible shell script for POSIX systems that generates
	a PDF version of the Reference Manual

You may edit the scripts in order to change the default XSLT and/or XSL-FO 
processors.
