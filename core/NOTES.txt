This folder contains a single Prolog file, `core.pl`, which implements
both the Logtalk compiler and the Logtalk runtime. There are also some
Logtalk files, such as `expanding.lgt` and `monitoring.lgt`, defining
built-in protocols, and `core_messages.lgt`, defining default translations
for Logtalk core messages.

Before loading the `core.pl` file into your favorite Prolog compiler,
you must first load the appropriated adapter file for your Prolog
compiler, which you will find in the `adapters` directory, and the
`paths/paths.pl` file, which defines essential library paths for
starting Logtalk.

The source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is
a tab width equivalent to 4 spaces).
