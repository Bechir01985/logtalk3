This directory contains Logtalk unit tests for built-in entities, predicates,
control constructs, directives, and methods. Besides this set of unit tests,
there are also unit tests defined for most of the examples and for some of
the code contributions.

On POSIX operating-systems, you can run all these tests by calling the shell
script `logtalk_tester` from the command-line. Type `man logtalk_tester` or
`logtalk_tester -h` for usage details, including how to select the back-end
Prolog compiler.

To run all the provided unit tests with e.g. SWI-Prolog as the back-end
compiler, open a terminal and type:

	$ cd $LOGTALKUSER/tests
	$ logtalk_tester -p swi
	...
	$ cd ../examples
	$ logtalk_tester -p swi
	...
